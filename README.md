# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Description

Tic Tac Toe is the classic children's game that we all know and love. This project is an online version of the game, developed using React and Vite.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command to install the dependencies:

1. npm install
2. After the installation, run the following command to start the application:
3.npm run dev
4.Open your web browser and go to the address http://localhost:3000 to start playing Tic Tac Toe

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I'd like to implement the possibility to select background color and image for each player.
Also, no change should be allowed on cells already used.

I'd implement these changes with use of a 'disabled' property, and select options somewhere on the screen for both color and image.
